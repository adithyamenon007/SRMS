This is a simple Student Record Management System made as a college project by me using HTML, PHP, Bootstrap and SQL.

The features: 
This software can help you insert student details into a database. 
It can delete any previously inserted student record.
It can modify any previously inserted student record.
It can display student records while providing the option to choose the student record to be displayed, display all the records existing, only toppers and only failures.

Steps to follow: 
1. Login
2. Select the task to be done in the navbar. 
3. Fill in the details asked in the page that you will be directed to.
4. That's about it. (pretty easy!)
